# Spring-Boot-Project
Creating 2 API’s to Perform CRUD Operation same as Twitter / Facebook. In which a user will have a profile which contains basic details of user. we can get user from DB, we can insert a User in DB, we should be able to delete the user from DB and update user profile.  there should be a wall kind of thing in which user can write on the wall and we should be able to get that post when i do get posts for that user

# so API's can be like this:


## piyush/user – methods (GET , POST , PUT , DELETE )

## piyush/user/wall – methods (GET , POST )


# We are also using Kafka to push some events or messages for every User Creation.
